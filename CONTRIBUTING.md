# Contributing to NVIDIA Broadcast for Linux

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project was built for the Linux community and contributions are welcome.

## Ground Rules

1. **All PRs require review** — No direct pushes to `main`. Every change goes through a pull request and needs approval from a maintainer.

2. **Keep attribution intact** — The `doczeus` copyright headers, UI credits, and LICENSE file must not be removed or modified. This is a legal requirement of the GPL-3.0 license.

3. **Be respectful** — We're all here because we love Linux and want better tools. Constructive feedback only.
