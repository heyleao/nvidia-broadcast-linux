  <em>NV Broadcast — Unofficial NV Broadcast and other OS. Open source. GPU accelerated. Built with passion.</em>

## Why I Built This

I left Windows. Millions of Linux users left Windows. But we all missed one thing — **NVIDIA Broadcast**.

That one app that made every video call look professional. Background blur that actually worked. Virtual backgrounds that didn't look like a PowerPoint slide. Noise cancellation that silenced your mechanical keyboard.

On Linux? Nothing. You had to cobble together 5 different tools, fight with v4l2loopback configs, and still get janky edges. **That's over now.**

I built this because I believe Linux users deserve the same broadcast-quality experience. Not a half-baked wrapper. Not a "good enough" hack. A real, proper implementation that uses your NVIDIA GPU to do what NVIDIA Broadcast does on Windows — **but open source, and in some ways, better.**

> *"Not saying this is perfect. But I believe it will be."*
>
> This is fast. This is optimized. And the quality already rivals Windows Broadcast. With the community behind it, we'll surpass it.

## What's New

### v1.1.7 — Live Edge and Mic Reliability Patch

- **Cleaner Hair and Hand Edges** — Background replace now holds hair edges, finger gaps, and hands near the body more cleanly during motion
- **Less Face-Effect Spill Into Hair** — Beautify and relighting stay lower on the face, so head hair and side hair look less bright and washed out
- **Mic Always Ready** — The exported `nvbroadcast` microphone now stays available even when voice effects and noise removal are turned off
- **Broader Release Verification** — This release was rechecked across video, audio, meeting transcription, summaries, packaging metadata, and release smoke before shipping

> If you are still on `v1.1.6` or older, update to `v1.1.7`. This is the recommended stable patch for current live edge quality and microphone reliability.

### v1.1.6 — Live Background Performance and Stability Patch

- **Fixed Background Reset Loops** — The live alpha path now uses one dedicated worker instead of bouncing inference across short-lived threads, which stops the CUDA invalid-resource-handle failures that could make replace mode collapse into repeated RVM resets
- **Lower Replace-Mode Live Cost** — Relighting now reuses the same-frame final matte instead of rebuilding it, and replace-mode matte work is cached more aggressively on the live path
- **Better Motion Handling Around Face Effects** — Beautify keeps GPU work local to the face ROI and preserves raw denoise history more carefully, reducing motion smear around the face and glasses
- **Safer Heavy Live Stack Behavior** — The app is better at keeping the background path responsive on heavier Meeting-style stacks instead of compounding lag with duplicate work

> If you are still on `v1.1.5` or older, update to `v1.1.6`. This is the recommended stable patch for the recent live background lag regression.

### v1.1.5 — Stability and Live Quality Patch

- **Safer Effect + Mode Switching** — Video pipeline rebuilds now wait for teardown properly, which reduces camera freezes, device-busy failures, and mode-switch crashes
- **TensorRT Detection Fixed** — Zeus and Killer now recognize current `tensorrt-cu12` installs correctly and handle the TensorRT handoff more safely
- **Duplicate Audio Devices Cleaned Up** — Stale `nvbroadcast` mic and speaker duplicates are deduped, and startup restore no longer churns the virtual-audio path as aggressively
- **Better Motion On Face + Glasses** — Beautify denoise is now limited to the face ROI and keeps raw history, which reduces motion smear and disappearing glasses during movement
- **Replace Mode Overlap Improved** — Raised hands near shoulders and underarms are less likely to blow false holes through the background during motion

> If you are still on `v1.1.4` or older, update to `v1.1.5`. This is the recommended stable patch for switch stability, TensorRT detection, and current live-quality fixes.

### v1.1.4 — Audio and Packaging Reliability Patch

- **Browser-Safe Processed Mic** — The Linux `nvbroadcast` microphone path is now stable for Chrome, Discord, Meet, and similar apps instead of hanging or opening with silence
- **Meeting Runtime Fixed** — The optional Whisper runtime installer now validates real imports before claiming success and includes the missing `httpx` dependency
- **Packaged Meeting Runtime** — Release installers now bundle the local meeting transcription runtime more consistently so packaged installs do not depend on the in-app runtime path as often
- **No External `ffmpeg` Requirement For Saved Meetings** — The app now reads its own saved WAV meeting capture directly for the final transcript pass
- **Release Checks Tightened** — Packaging CI is opted into Node 24 early, and release smoke now covers dependency-installer, transcriber, summarizer, meeting-store, and packaging metadata checks

> If you are still on `v1.1.3` or older, update to `v1.1.4`. This is the recommended stable patch for meeting audio reliability and packaged runtime consistency.

### v1.1.3 — Meeting-First Live Quality Update

- **Lower Visible Delay** — Live video now prefers the newest frames instead of letting stale buffers build up, which reduces the odd “lips move late” effect in meetings
- **Auto - Adaptive Mode** — Hardware-aware tuning now persists across restart, warns on very weak devices, and can recommend lighter capture modes when real-time FPS collapses
- **Better Live Face Effects** — Face relighting is now fill-light biased instead of darkening the face, and eye contact is more conservative so it distorts less
- **Meeting-Selectable Mic** — The processed mic is exported as `nvbroadcast`, so Zoom, Meet, Teams, OBS, and similar apps can select it directly
- **Correct Speaker Routing** — Speaker denoise now honors the selected output device instead of whichever sink the system guessed
- **Release + Update Flow** — The app now surfaces platform-aware upgrade targets for GitHub releases, macOS `.pkg` downloads, and Snap installs

> If you are still on `v1.1.2` or older, update to `v1.1.3`. This is the recommended stable build for live meetings, adaptive tuning, and corrected audio routing.

### v1.1.2 — Priority Stability Update

- **Meeting Transcript Quality** — Better chunk cleanup and a stronger final full-audio pass improve saved transcripts and notes
- **No End-Meeting Freeze** — Meeting transcript, notes, and summary finalization now run off the UI thread
- **Persistent Speaker + Profile State** — Speaker selection and the active profile now restore correctly after restart
- **Reset to Defaults** — One-click recovery back to a known-good baseline
- **Mic Test Fixed** — Recording and playback are more reliable, with `30s`, `45s`, and `60s` capture options plus early stop

> If you are still on `v1.1.0` or `v1.1.1`, update to `v1.1.2`. It is the recommended stable patch for meeting quality, persistence, and audio test reliability.

### v1.1.1 — Stability Patch

- **Virtual Camera Stability** — Safer Linux `v4l2loopback` sink startup and retry handling
- **Lower Live Lag** — Shared face landmarks and face-ROI relighting reduce delay in heavier effect stacks
- **Better Replace Edges** — Tighter shoulders, ear-side hair, and under-arm gaps during background replace
- **Meeting Transcription Reliability** — Faster startup, shorter chunking, and cleaner saved meeting audio
- **Resolution Change Safety** — Resolution changes are saved safely and applied after restart instead of hanging the stream

> If you are still on `v1.1.0`, update to `v1.1.1`. It improved virtual-camera behavior, lower lag, and cleaner live compositing.

### v1.1.0 — Meeting Assistant Update

- **Meeting Assistant Sidebar** — Collapsible live transcript and rolling summary inside the app
- **Meeting History** — Local session history stays on-device for 7 days with automatic cleanup
- **Two-Way Meeting Audio** — Meeting capture records both sides for better local notes and transcripts
- **Background Runtime Installs** — Optional CUDA, TensorRT, and meeting runtimes install in the background with progress

### Fused CUDA Kernel (DocZeus/Killer)

A custom CUDA kernel that performs alpha blend + enhance + sharpen + vignette in **one GPU pass**:

```cuda
// Single kernel: fg*alpha + bg*(1-alpha) + enhance + vignette
// 0.1ms at 1080p — 150x faster than CuPy's multi-kernel approach
extern "C" __global__ void fused_composite(
    fg, bg, alpha, face_mask, vignette, output,
    total_pixels, enhance_i, vignette_i, brightness, contrast, warmth
);
```

### Edge Refinement Network

When Edge Refine is toggled ON (Zeus/Killer modes):

1. **Fast pass**: RVM at 360p/480p → coarse alpha (18-21ms)
2. **Refine pass**: RVM ResNet50 at 720p → quality alpha (30ms, every 2nd frame)
3. **Blend**: On refine frames use quality alpha; on skip frames 80% quality + 20% coarse for tracking
4. **Result**: 89.9% quality recovery with minimal cost

## Installation

### Linux — One Command Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hkshoonya/nvidia-broadcast-linux.git
cd nvidia-broadcast-linux
./install.sh
```

### macOS — One Command Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hkshoonya/nvidia-broadcast-linux.git
cd nvidia-broadcast-linux
./install_macos.sh
```

Requires macOS 12+, Homebrew, Python 3.11+. Installs GStreamer, GTK4 via Homebrew.
CPU modes with CoreML acceleration on Apple Silicon. GPU modes (Killer/Zeus/DocZeus/CUDA) are Linux-only and require an NVIDIA GPU.

### Linux — Snap Package

```bash
sudo snap install nvbroadcast
```

Snap users typically receive background refreshes from `snapd`. When the app sees a newer stable release, the in-app update button opens the Snap Store listing so the user can move directly into the store-managed upgrade path.

Packaged releases are intended to include the local meeting transcription runtime. Source installs from this repo can still use the in-app runtime installer flow for optional components.

### Linux Installer Details

The installer:
1. **Detects your distro** and package manager
2. **Checks all requirements** (Python, PipeWire, GPU, DKMS, kernel headers)
3. **Installs missing packages** with the correct names for your distro
4. **Asks about compositing** — CPU, GStreamer GL, or CuPy CUDA
5. **Sets up virtual camera**, launcher scripts, desktop entry, systemd service
6. **Verifies GPU acceleration** and writes initial config
7. **Lets optional runtimes install later** inside the app without blocking the rest of the UI

### Update Behavior

- **Git checkout / manual Linux packages** — the app checks GitHub Releases and opens the matching release download page when a newer stable build is available
- **macOS package installs** — the app prefers the latest `.pkg` release asset when one is published
- **Snap installs** — the app opens the Snap Store listing; stable refreshes are normally handled by `snapd`

### Optional: TensorRT (for Zeus/Killer modes)

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install tensorrt-cu12 onnx
```

TensorRT Python wheels are currently published for Python `3.8` through `3.13`
on Linux `x86_64`. If you are on Python `3.14+`, use `DocZeus` or the CUDA
modes instead.

## Usage

### Setup Once, Forget Forever

```bash
nvbroadcast          # Launch GUI (first time: setup wizard)
```

1. **Setup wizard** detects your system and configures the best mode
2. App starts and auto-begins streaming
3. Configure effects, select resolution/FPS/mode
4. **Close the window** — app minimizes to background, virtual camera stays active
5. Open **Chrome / Zoom / Discord / OBS** — select **"NVIDIA Broadcast"** as your camera
6. **Next login** — app starts automatically with all your settings remembered

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Resolution** | 360p to 4K — auto-detected from camera, applied safely after restart |
| **FPS** | 15-60fps — adapts to selected resolution |
| **Mode** | 9 modes: Killer, Zeus, DocZeus, CUDA, CPU |
| **Mirror** | Horizontal flip on/off |
| **Edge Refine** | Neural edge refinement (Zeus/Killer) |
| **Pause View** | Freeze preview display |
| **Hide Preview** | Collapse preview for more control space |
| **Drag Divider** | Resize preview vs controls area |

### Headless Mode

```bash
nvbroadcast-vcam                    # No GUI, just the virtual camera
nvbroadcast-vcam --format i420      # Firefox-compatible format
```

### As a System Service

```bash
systemctl --user enable nvbroadcast-vcam
systemctl --user start nvbroadcast-vcam
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Chrome doesn't see the virtual camera</strong></summary>

1. Go to `chrome://flags`
2. Search **"PipeWire"**
3. **Disable** "PipeWire Camera" flag
4. Restart Chrome

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Device busy" error</strong></summary>

Another app is using the camera. Close it or run:
```bash
fuser -k /dev/video0
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>No GPU acceleration (running on CPU)</strong></summary>

Reinstall CUDA runtime libraries:
```bash
.venv/bin/pip install --force-reinstall nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12 \
    nvidia-cudnn-cu12 nvidia-curand-cu12 nvidia-cufft-cu12 nvidia-cusparse-cu12 \
    nvidia-cusolver-cu12 nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12 nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Resolution changes do not apply immediately</strong></summary>

Resolution changes are now saved safely and applied after you stop and start the app again. This avoids the live-pipeline hang path that some cameras and loopback setups hit during hot restarts.

If a camera still behaves oddly after restart, verify its real supported modes:
```bash
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --list-formats-ext   # Check supported resolutions
```

- **Meeting lip-sync compensation** — explicit audio/video delay calibration so heavy live video stacks still land naturally in calls
- **Per-device auto benchmark** — benchmark each camera mode and effect stack once, then pin the best stable settings for that machine
- **Speaker diarization** — separate “me” vs “remote speaker” in live meeting transcripts and saved notes
- **Local live captions** — optional on-screen captions and confidence-aware subtitle output for streams and calls
- **Multi-person framing** — presenter mode for interviews, podcasts, and side-by-side calls
- **AI meeting memory** — on-device semantic search across prior meetings, summaries, action items, and decisions
- **Scene-aware relighting** — stronger face light that reacts to background direction, exposure, and skin tone without flattening the face
- **Quality advisor** — explain exactly which effect, resolution, or backend is costing FPS on the current hardware
